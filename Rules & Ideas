What should my project have?

*1. Options : Search, add, delete, rename/edit, display function to display the contact if not empty 
 
*2. A list of names arranged alphabetically

*3. New contact first created and validified then added:  When new name added, should be rearranged alphabetically,

*4. One or multiple deletion at once must be permissible

5. Favourites - Marking certain contacts (how to do that? : You can try with pointers)  
                                              OR
               Create an array that stores the position of the contacts that are marked as favourites

6. I will provide a list of alphabets from A to Z,

  If you press A, you will get a list of names starting with A and so on.
