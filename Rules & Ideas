Project : Contact Management System


Tools:

1. First Learn file handling and boolean datatypes

2. Linkedlist or arrays to store a list of contact names, numbers, and email address

3. strings for storing email adress, names : validfy email address by checking if last letters are "@gmail.com"

   **String functions as header file and string handling**

4. use int variables to store numbers

5. You have to string sorting algorithm

6. Store all information in .txt file extension and access them using file handling


What should my project have?

*1. Options : Search, add, delete, rename/edit, display function to display the contact if not empty 
 
*2. A list of names arranged alphabetically

*3. New contact first created and validified then added:  When new name added, should be rearranged alphabetically,

*4. One or multiple deletion at once must be permissible

5. Favourites - Marking certain contacts (how to do that? : You can try with pointers)  
                                              OR
               Create an array that stores the position of the contacts that are marked as favourites

6. I will provide a list of alphabets from A to Z,

  If you press A, you will get a list of names starting with A and so on.
